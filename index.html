        <h3>CRISTIANO RONALDO dos SANTOS AVEIRO</h3>
        <p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro (born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards,[note 3] a record three UEFA Men's Player of the Year Awards, and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 33 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, most appearances (30), assists (8), goals in the European Championship (14), international goals (130) and international appearances (212). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,200 professional career appearances, the most by an outfield player, and has scored over 890 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the top goalscorer of all time.
            <br><br>

            Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four Champions Leagues from 2014 to 2018, including La Décima. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, two UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player and became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his contract was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr.

            <br><br>
            
            
            Ronaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has earned more than 200 caps, making him history's most-capped male player.[10] With 130 international goals, he is also the all-time top male goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in and scored at eleven major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement would see him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020.
            <br><br>
            
            
            One of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016, 2017, and 2023, and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. He is the first footballer and the third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career.</p>

                    <p>Ronaldo's overhead bicycle kick for Real Madrid against Juventus in the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals is one of the most iconic moments of his career The goal was so extraordinary that it earned a standing ovation from the Juventus crowd, an uncommon sight for an opposing player.


                        Ronaldo executed a remarkable bicycle kick, defying gravity to connect with the ball soaring at a height of 2.3 meters. Meanwhile, Ronaldo's body hovered 1.4 meters above the lush green grass field. His display of athleticism and precision left spectators in awe.</p>

                    <p>Cristiano Ronaldo’s goal for Manchester United against Porto in 2009 travelled at an astonishing average speed of 103 kilometres per hour – a record for a FIFA Puskás Award winner that is in no danger of disappearing at The Best FIFA Football Awards™ on Monday. The thunderbolt is also the victor struck from the furthest distance out: 40 yards.

                        🗣️ "If you asked me how to score a goal like that I wouldn’t be able to tell you."

                    <p>United were given a free-kick some 40 yards out.

                        Despite Ronaldo standing over the ball and being one of the greatest free-kick takers in the world, Arsenal decided to only put two men in the wall.
                        
                        The Gunners clearly didn't fancy Ronaldo's chances of scoring from the free-kick.
                        
                        It was so far out that, just before Ronaldo struck the ball, ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley uttered the words: "Too far out for Ronaldo to think about it..."
                        
                        Seconds later, Ronaldo made Tyldesley look silly as he lashed the ball with some venom at goal. Manuel Almunia was completely deceived as the ball crashed into the net.
                        
                        A stunned Tyldesley then said: "OH! Absolutely sensational! It went through Almunia [who was] beaten for pace. Manchester United have scored twice in little more than 10 minutes here! Cristiano Ronaldo has matched the scorcher he scored in Porto!"
